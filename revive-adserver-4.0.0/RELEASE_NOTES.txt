Release Notes: Revive Adserver 4.0.0
====================================

These release notes cover what's new, system requirements, download and
installation instructions, known issues and frequently asked questions for
Revive Adserver. Please read these notes before reporting any bugs.


What's New in Revive Adserver 4.0.0
-----------------------------------

 * Release date: 2016-09-28

 Security Updates
 ----------------

 * Multiple vulnerabilities fixed. For more details, please see:
   http://www.revive-adserver.com/security/revive-sa-2016-002

 New Features
 ------------

 * Added support for the PHP mysqli extension, allowing Revive Adserver to
   work on PHP7+ without having to install the legacy mysql extension from
   pecl.

 * Replaced old phpSniff with a modern alternative (Sinergi Browser detector),
   with a significant speed improvement.

 * Added support for both Memcache and Memcached extensions in the oxMemcached
   plugin.

 * Increased HTML banner size hard limit from 64k to 16MB on MySQL,
   by changing TEXT fields to MEDIUMTEXT. No change on Postgres, where the
   maximum field size has always been 1GB.

 * Improved .htaccess compatibility with Apache 2.4+.

 * Improved error reporting when installing Revive Adserver when the PHP session
   save path is not writable.

 * Moved database type dropdown out of the hidden advanced settings section
   during install.

 * Added a new blankAdSelect plugin hook to eventually fill in blank impressions
   with fallback material.

 Bug Fixes
 ---------

 * Fixed an issue where impressions, clicks and conversions that had not been
   successfully delivered in now inactive contract campaigns were being
   incorrectly taken into account when allocating impressions to zones, lowering
   the available impression count available for active campaigns, resulting in
   under-delivery.

   Investigation and fix sponsored by Online Buddies, Inc.

 * Fixed an issue with delivery capping / blocking not working when a page
   using async tags was forcibly reloaded soon after serving a capped banner.

 * Fixed an issue with the upload of SWF banners with hardcoded links
   triggering a permissions error when the conversion feature was enabled.

 * Fixed an issue with some banners showing underlined text when displayed with
   async JS tags.

 * Fixed an issue with banners created via the API always being flagged as
   "iframe friendly". The fix only applies to newly created banners.

 * Fixed an issue with Doubleclick 3rd party click tracking plugin not
   recognizing https URLs.

 * Fixed an issue with the "UTC" timezone only being available if configured
   as a PHP default timezone. Also removed the non-standard "GB" timezone.

 * Fixed an issue with some report emails being sent with duplicate "To"
   headers, causing them to be rejected by some MTAs or spam filters.

 * Removed an hardcoded reference to the "asyncspc.php" delivery script,
   preventing the users from renaming it.

 Non-Backwards Compatible Changes
 --------------------------------

 * Revive Adserver now requires PHP 5.5.9+.

 * Client Delivery Limitations:

   * Support for delivery limitations against older browser types has been
     dropped in Revive Adserver 4.0.0. As a result, existing Client - Browser
     delivery limitations for all browser types other than Chrome, Firefox,
     Internet Explorer, Safari and Opera will be removed as part of the upgrade
     process.

   * Support for delivery limitations against older operating systems has been
     dropped in Revive Adserver 4.0.0. As a result, existing Client - Operating
     system delivery limitations for all operating system types other than
     Windows 7, Windows XP, Windows 2000, Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris and Mac OSX
     will be removed as part of the upgrade process.

   * Users with either existing Client - Browser or Client - Operating system
     delivery limitations are advised that they should check delivery
     limitations before and after upgrading to Revive Adserver 4.0.0, to ensure
     that the limitations set remain valid for the desired delivery behavior.

 * Support for 3rd party click tracking of Rich Media - Google AdSense and
   Rich Media - Yahoo! Publisher Network banners has been removed, as these were
   not working. Banners configured to use these 3rd party click tracking options
   will be switched to the "Generic HTML banner" tracking option during the
   upgrade.

 * Browser and Operating System detection speed has been optimized, and as a
   result, the browser and operating system are only detected if necessary.
   Plugins that need access to this information during delivery will need to be
   updated to use the provided wrapper to perform browser/operating system
   detection. Please see the core Browser/Operating System delivery limitations
   plugin code for a usage example.

Known Issues

   have a large database.

 * If you want to run Revive Adserver with MySQL, please note that MySQL 4.1 or
   higher is required. If you are using an older version of MySQL, you will
   need to update you database software before upgrading.
